Version 2.0
---------
 
 * Major update!
 

Version 1.1 (1st September 2013)
---------

 - You can now zoom the arrangement view. (Use the mouse wheel, or SHIFT+ARROWS)
 - Now supports double pattern sizes: up to 32 notes per pattern instead of 16.
 - Added global effects (delay, chorus, distortion, a bunch more!)
 - Added tab for advanced settings (replaces the weird HOLD LEFT secret)
 - The .ceol file type is properly associated now. You can double click a .ceol file to load it.
 
LITTLE THINGS:

 - You can use WASD instead of the arrow keys now.
 - Long notes stop playing when you start and stop the track.
 - Support for different window sizes (x1, x2, x3 etc)
 - Placing a short note on a long note removes the long note.
 - Escape key quits.
 - Added program icon.
 
BUGS:
 
 - BPM now set correctly when creating new song / loading a song with a different BPM.
 - Copying columns works properly now.
 - Fixed fullscreen setting bug. Should remember fullscreen/window settings.

---------

 New Features:
  - You can copy and paste columns from the arrangement view - copy the entire currently looping region with CTRL+C, and paste it with CTRL+V.

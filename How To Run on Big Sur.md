Okay so here’s what I did to make it work in Big Sur (Woking on Mac M1)

**Prerequisites**

In order to run it you will need Adobe Air installed on your Mac you can get it from : [Click Here](https://airsdk.harman.com/runtime)

**Installation**

So as soon as you download the dmg file install it and enter your password if it asks

Great you’re just one step away from getting BoscaCeoil up and running

Download the [BoscaCeoilV3.app](https://github.com/Pikachuxxxx/boscaceoil/raw/master/BoscaCeoilV3.app.zip) and double click it and it should open up like any other app.

If it says "“BoscaCeoilV3.app.app” cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified.", go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy, then click on the padlock, enter your password and click on “Open anyway” at the bottom and accept. Bosca Ceoil should launch.
